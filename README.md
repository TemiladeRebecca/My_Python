# My Coffee Machine Program

This is a program that receives inputs from the user on their choice of different coffee flavours(espresso, latte and cappuccino)
It gives the coffee cost depending on their choice of flavor. The user has the choice to proceed with the transaction if they are comfortable with the amount or terminate it.
If they chose to proceed, the machine requests for money in coins(quarter, dime, nickel or penny), and then calculates if the amount inputed is sufficient for the coffee.
If sufficient, the coffee machine returns the excess in change. If not the machine returns the amount inputed back to the user
The machine also checks the resources available against the ingredients required to make the coffee flavour.
We can print the report from the machine on resources available and profit.
The coffee machine can also be turned off for maintenance.
